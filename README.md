Course Project 2 - Getting and Cleaning Data

This repo provides the R code corresponding to the second course project. The aim was to create a tidy data set containing the mean values of 561 variables, for each subject and each activity.

Here are the steps the file "run_analysis.R" provides:
1.    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This results in a data frame named "results".
